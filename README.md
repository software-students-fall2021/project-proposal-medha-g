# Headline
A website that uses current trends to predict the stock market.

## What and why?
I would build a full stack application that allows users to input a stock and have a sentiment analysis algorithm run to display a graph and predictive statistics about the future of the stock using news headlines regarding the stock and its relevant industry. It would help investment bankers and those who have investments in stocks stay updated about how news is impacting the financial sector. It's important to understand these trends when making financial decisions.

## For whom?
The end users would be those who have investments in stocks or depend on them to dictate decisions made in their professions or anyone who enjoys looking at stocks. 

## How?
The system will allow users to choose a publicly traded stock and view a graph, timeline, and predictive statistics on a web app about its future based on past and present news cycles.

## Scope
The project could be implemented first with just creating the sentiment analysis algorithm and training it on one data set of news api for a single stock, then it can be expanded and trained on broader data to be applied to more and more stocks. Finally, a nice front facing web page with different metrics can be created.
